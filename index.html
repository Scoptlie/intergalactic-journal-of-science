			Greetings humble web surfur, and welcome to the Intergalactic Journal of Science!
			This is not, as the name might suggest, a real scientific publication, but merely my own personal blog and creative outlet.
			Right now there isn't much here, but perhaps if you wait long enough some entries will appear on the <a href="/entries.html">entries</a> page.
			When they do, you're welcome to have a look at them if it fancies you.
		</p>
		<p>
		Until then, have fun out there.
